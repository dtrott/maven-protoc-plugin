Maven Protoc Plugin

  The Protoc Plugin uses the Protocol Buffer Compiler (<<<protoc>>>) tool to generate java source files
  from <<<.proto>>> (protocol buffer definition) files for the specified project.
  For more information about the Protocol Buffer Compiler, please refer to
  {{{http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/reference/java-generated.html}Reference Guide}}.

  The Plugin automatically scans all project dependencies for bundled <<<.proto>>> files,
  and configures <<<proto_path>>> of the Protocol Buffer Compiler to use those files as imports.

  The Plugin automatically attaches the source <<<.proto>>> files to the resources of the project,
  so that they are later packaged into the final artifact and can be referenced as imports
  from the dependent projects or modules.

* Goals Overview

  The Protoc Plugin has the following goals:

  * {{{./compile-mojo.html}protoc:compile}}
    compiles main <<<.proto>>> definitions into java files and attaches the generated java sources to the project.

  * {{{./testCompile-mojo.html}protoc:testCompile}}
    compiles test <<<.proto>>> definitions into java files and attaches the generated java test sources to the project.
